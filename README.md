# Route_Optimization_ACO_VS_TSP
This website is built using Django and on the purpose of showcasing my Project on Route optimization.
In this website we take a number of cities and then find the optimal path from the first city to all the other cities. Here we compare two approaches->Traditional TSP(Optimal TSP)
and ACO(ant colony optimization). We compare them in the context of the total distance given and the execution time.
Here is the link for viewing the demonstration of the project:https://route-optimization-aco-vs-tsp.onrender.com
